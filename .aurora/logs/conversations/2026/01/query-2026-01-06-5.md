## Phase: Collect

```json
{
  "research": "Based on the query \"what is 2+2? and why?\", I can provide a direct answer without needing web search, as this is fundamental mathematics:\n\n## Answer to Subgoal 1: Calculate 2+2\n\n**2 + 2 = 4**\n\n## Answer to Subgoal 2: Why does 2+2 equal 4?\n\nThe reason 2+2 equals 4 is grounded in several mathematical principles:\n\n1. **Definition of Natural Numbers**: In mathematics, we define natural numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, ...) through the Peano axioms, which establish how counting works.\n\n2. **Definition of Addition**: Addition is defined as the operation of combining two quantities. When we have 2 objects and add 2 more objects, we count the total: 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n3. **Successor Function**: In formal mathematics, addition can be defined recursively:\n   - 2 + 0 = 2\n   - 2 + 1 = 3 (the successor of 2)\n   - 2 + 2 = the successor of (2 + 1) = the successor of 3 = 4\n\n4. **Set Theory Basis**: Using set theory, if we have a set with 2 elements {a, b} and another set with 2 elements {c, d}, their union (assuming no overlap) has 4 elements {a, b, c, d}.\n\n5. **Empirical Verification**: This can be verified physically - if you have 2 apples and someone gives you 2 more apples, counting them yields 4 apples total.\n\nThis result is considered a mathematical truth because it follows necessarily from the axioms and definitions we use for arithmetic. It's one of the most fundamental facts in mathematics and forms the basis for more complex mathematical reasoning."

## Phase: Synthesize

```json
{
  "synthesis": "# Answer\n\n**2 + 2 = 4**\n\n## Why This is True\n\nThis fundamental arithmetic fact is grounded in several layers of mathematical reasoning:\n\n**Foundational Definitions:**\n- Natural numbers (1, 2, 3, 4...) are formally defined through the Peano axioms\n- Addition is the operation of combining quantities\n\n**Mathematical Proofs:**\n1. **Recursive Definition**: Addition can be proven through successive counting:\n   - 2 + 1 = 3 (successor of 2)\n   - 2 + 2 = successor of (2 + 1) = successor of 3 = 4\n\n2. **Set Theory**: Union of two 2-element sets {a,b} \u222a {c,d} = {a,b,c,d} contains 4 elements\n\n3. **Physical Verification**: Empirically testable - combining 2 objects with 2 more objects yields 4 objects when counted\n\nThis result follows necessarily from the axioms of arithmetic and serves as one of mathematics' most basic truths, forming the foundation for all higher-level mathematical reasoning."

## Phase: Respond

```json
{
  "final_answer": "# 2 + 2 = 4\n\n## The Answer\n\n**2 + 2 equals 4**\n\nThis is one of the most fundamental truths in mathematics.\n\n## Why This is True\n\n### Mathematical Foundations\n\n**Axiomatic Basis:**\n- Natural numbers are defined through the Peano axioms (developed by Giuseppe Peano in 1889)\n- Addition is formally defined as the operation of combining quantities\n- The number 4 is defined as the successor of 3, which is the successor of 2\n\n**Proof Methods:**\n\n1. **Recursive Counting:**\n   - 2 + 1 = 3 (by definition of successor)\n   - 2 + 2 = (2 + 1) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n2. **Set Theory:**\n   - Take two distinct sets with 2 elements each: {a, b} and {c, d}\n   - Their union contains exactly 4 elements: {a, b, c, d}\n\n3. **Physical Verification:**\n   - Place 2 objects together with 2 more objects\n   - Count the total: you will always get 4 objects\n\n### Why It's Always True\n\nThis result is:\n- **Universal:** True in all contexts and cultures\n- **Necessary:** Cannot be otherwise within standard arithmetic\n- **Fundamental:** Forms the basis for all higher mathematics\n- **Empirically verifiable:** Can be demonstrated with physical objects\n\nThe certainty of \"2 + 2 = 4\" represents the reliability of mathematical reasoning itself and serves as the foundation upon which more complex mathematical structures are built."
