      "answer": "I can provide information on the current state of AI/AGI developments based on my knowledge cutoff (January 2025), though I should note that this is general knowledge rather than requiring codebase exploration.\n\n## Current State of AI (as of January 2025)\n\n**Key Developments:**\n\n1. **Frontier Models**: Companies like Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and others have released increasingly capable large language models (LLMs) with improved reasoning, coding, and multimodal capabilities.\n\n2. **Notable Achievements**:\n   - **Reasoning Models**: OpenAI's o1/o3 models and similar systems showing enhanced multi-step reasoning\n   - **Multimodal AI**: Models handling text, images, video, and audio simultaneously\n   - **Long Context**: Models with context windows extending to millions of tokens\n   - **Agent Systems**: AI systems that can use tools, execute code, and work autonomously on complex tasks\n\n3. **AGI Progress**:\n   - We're still in the \"narrow AI\" phase - systems excel at specific tasks but lack general intelligence\n   - No true AGI exists yet (defined as AI matching or exceeding human-level performance across all cognitive tasks)\n   - Progress toward AGI remains a subject of debate regarding timelines and definitions\n\n4. **Industry Applications**:\n   - Code generation and software development assistance\n   - Scientific research acceleration (protein folding, drug discovery)\n   - Creative tools for content generation\n   - Enhanced search and information retrieval\n\n**Reality Check**: While AI capabilities have advanced significantly, we haven't achieved AGI. Current systems are powerful tools but lack genuine understanding, consciousness, or general problem-solving abilities across all domains like humans possess.\n\nWould you like me to search for more recent information online, or were you asking this in relation to the Aurora project specifically?\n",
