## Overview

This document specifies the planning approach and decomposition strategy for achieving the goal: Test simple goal for verification

## Planning Strategy

### Decomposition Approach
The goal has been decomposed into 3 manageable subgoals, each assigned to a specialized agent. Subgoals are ordered by dependencies and can be executed in parallel where no dependencies exist.

### Agent Assignment Rationale
- **sg-1** (@holistic-architect): Best suited for this type of work
- **sg-2** (@full-stack-dev): Best suited for this type of work
- **sg-3** (@qa-test-architect): Best suited for this type of work

## Dependency Analysis

### Critical Path
To be determined during implementation.

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
Subgoals with no dependencies can be executed in parallel.

---

## Risk Assessment

### Complexity Factors
- **Overall Complexity**: simple
- **Number of Subgoals**: 3
- **Cross-team Dependencies**: 0

### Planning Assumptions
- All required resources are available
- No external blockers
- Agent assignments are appropriate

---

## Success Criteria for Planning

- [ ] All subgoals clearly defined
- [ ] Agent assignments appropriate
- [ ] Dependencies identified and manageable
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Risks identified and mitigated
