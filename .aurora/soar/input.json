  "prompt": "Original Query: how do i improve my current memory retrieval that has bm25, git and based on ACT-R?\n\nSynthesized Answer:\nTo improve your current memory retrieval system that combines BM25, git, and ACT-R principles, consider these approaches: **BM25 Optimization:** - Fine-tune BM25 parameters (k1 and b) for your specific document collection - Implement query expansion using synonyms or related terms - Consider adding semantic understanding through embedding-based retrieval as a hybrid approach alongside BM25 **Git-based Retrieval Enhancement:** - Leverage git history to weight more recently modified or frequently changed documents - Use commit messages and diffs as additional indexable content - Implement temporal decay based on last commit timestamps to prioritize fresh content **ACT-R Integration:** - Apply activation spreading from ACT-R to boost relevance of recently/frequently accessed items - Implement base-level activation decay (d parameter) to model forgetting - Use associative strength between memories to improve context-aware retrieval - Consider implementing retrieval latency based on activation levels **Hybrid Approach:** - Combine BM25 scores with ACT-R activation values as a weighted sum - Use git metadata (recency, change frequency) as signals in your activation calculations - Implement a learning mechanism to adjust weights based on retrieval success Without seeing the actual agent analysis outputs, I'd recommend using the **business-analyst** agent to assess your current implementation's strengths/weaknesses, followed by the **holistic-architect** agent to design the improvement strategy.\n\nAgent Outputs:\n\n\nVerify this synthesis and provide quality assessment in JSON format.",
  "system": "You are a quality verifier for synthesized responses.\n\nYour task is to verify that a synthesis meets quality standards:\n\n1. COHERENCE: Is the synthesis well-structured, logical, and clear?\n2. COMPLETENESS: Does it address all aspects of the original query?\n3. FACTUALITY: Are all claims properly grounded in agent outputs?\n\nScore each dimension from 0.0 to 1.0, then calculate overall_score as the average.\n\nYou MUST respond with valid JSON only.
