  "prompt": "Original Query: analyze the SOAR verify phase implementation\n\nSynthesized Answer:\nUnfortunately, I cannot provide a meaningful synthesis of the SOAR verify phase implementation based on the agent outputs received. All four agents (master, full-stack-dev, holistic-architect, and qa-test-architect) returned initial greeting responses without actually executing the requested analysis tasks. Each agent asked for clarification rather than performing their assigned subgoals: - **Agent: master** was supposed to locate SOAR verify phase code files and documentation but instead provided a general project overview - **Agent: full-stack-dev** was tasked with analyzing verify phase implementation logic, validation methods, and data flow but only asked what task to perform - **Agent: holistic-architect** should have examined integration points but returned a general readiness message - **Agent: qa-test-architect** was assigned to review test coverage but simply asked for instructions The agents appear to have not received or processed their specific subgoal instructions properly, resulting in generic startup responses rather than targeted analysis of the SOAR verify phase. To properly answer your query about the SOAR verify phase implementation, the agents would need to: 1. Locate relevant code files (likely in `packages/soar/` based on git status showing modifications to `orchestrator.py`) 2. Analyze the verification logic and validation methods 3. Map integration points with other SOAR phases (Sense, Observe, Act, Route) 4. Review test coverage for the verify phase\n\nAgent Outputs:\n\nAgent 0 (master):\nSummary: I notice you haven't provided a specific task or question. I'm here to help you with this Aurora project.\n\nBased on the context, this appears to be a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system with:\n- A SOAR (presumably Sense-Observe-Act-Route) orchestration framework\n- Multiple specialized agents for different roles (UX, QA, Product Management, Development, etc.)\n- Integration with Claude Code for AI-assisted development\n- Recent work on SOAR simplification and JSON serialization fixes\n\nWhat would you like me to help you with? For example:\n- Debug or fix an issue\n- Implement a new feature\n- Review or refactor code\n- Understand how something works\n- Plan an architectural change\n- Create documentation\n\nPlease let me know what you'd like to accomplish, and I'll assist accordingly.\n\nConfidence: 0.85\n\nAgent 1 (full-stack-dev):\nSummary: I'll help you with your task. However, I notice you haven't specified what you'd like me to do. Could you please provide more details about what you need help with?\n\nBased on the project context, I can see this is the Aurora project which appears to be related to AI workflow orchestration and planning. I'm ready to assist with:\n\n- Code implementation or debugging\n- Feature development\n- Architecture or design questions\n- Documentation\n- Testing\n- Or any other development tasks\n\nWhat would you like me to work on?\n\nConfidence: 0.85\n\nAgent 2 (holistic-architect):\nSummary: I'm ready to help you with your Aurora project! I can see you have a sophisticated multi-agent system with SOAR orchestration capabilities.\n\nLooking at your recent git status, I notice:\n- Modified SOAR-related files (input.json, output.json, state.json, orchestrator.py)\n- A task file about SOAR simplification\n- Several test conversation logs\n- Documentation about SOAR simplification issues\n\nWhat would you like to work on? I can help with:\n- SOAR system debugging or enhancements\n- Task implementation from your task files\n- Architecture improvements\n- Documentation updates\n- Testing and verification\n\nOr if you have something else in mind, just let me know!\n\nConfidence: 0.85\n\nAgent 3 (qa-test-architect):\nSummary: I'll help you with your request. Could you please tell me what you'd like me to work on?\n\nConfidence: 0.85\n\n\nVerify this synthesis and provide quality assessment in JSON format.",
