  "prompt": "Original Query: what are the key differences between SOAR and traditional AI architectures?\n\nSynthesized Answer:\nI was unable to provide a complete answer to your query about the key differences between SOAR and traditional AI architectures. The agent outputs indicate that the specialized agents (business-analyst and holistic-architect) I invoked did not receive clear task instructions from the decomposition process, and instead responded with generic \"ready to help\" messages rather than conducting the requested research. From the limited context available in your project's git repository, I can see that SOAR appears to be a \"Structured Orchestration and Routing\" or \"Structured Orchestrated Agentic Reasoning\" system (different terms appear in the outputs), but the agents did not successfully retrieve or analyze the architectural documentation that would explain how it differs from traditional AI architectures. To properly answer your question, I would need to: 1. Read the SOAR architecture documentation in your codebase (likely in `.aurora/` or `packages/soar/` directories) 2. Research traditional AI architecture patterns 3. Perform a comparative analysis Would you like me to directly explore the codebase files to understand the SOAR architecture and then provide you with a comparison? I can read the relevant documentation and code files myself rather than relying on agent decomposition.\n\nAgent Outputs:\n\nAgent 0 (business-analyst):\nSummary: I'm ready to help you with tasks in the Aurora project. I can see this is a git repository with several modified files related to SOAR (presumably a structured orchestration and reasoning system).\n\nBased on the context, I have access to:\n- Various specialized agents (orchestrator, product manager, QA architect, full-stack dev, etc.)\n- Task management workflows\n- Skills and commands for different types of work\n\nWhat would you like me to help you with today?\n\nSome examples of what I can do:\n- Help with code implementation or debugging\n- Create or review documentation\n- Plan and break down features\n- Review and improve code quality\n- Analyze the codebase structure\n\nJust let me know what you need!\n\nConfidence: 0.85\n\nAgent 1 (business-analyst):\nSummary: I'm ready to assist you with your Aurora project. I can see this is a Python project with a SOAR (Structured Orchestrated Agentic Reasoning) implementation and various agent-based workflows.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you with today?\n\nConfidence: 0.85\n\nAgent 2 (holistic-architect):\nSummary: I'll help you with your task. However, I notice you haven't specified what you'd like me to do. \n\nBased on the context, I can see this is an Aurora project with a SOAR (Structured Orchestration and Routing) system. There are some uncommitted changes in:\n- `.aurora/soar/input.json`\n- `.aurora/soar/output.json`\n- `.aurora/soar/state.json`\n- `packages/soar/src/aurora_soar/orchestrator.py`\n- `packages/soar/src/aurora_soar/phases/collect.py`\n\nCould you please tell me what you'd like me to help you with? For example:\n- Review or commit the current changes\n- Implement a new feature\n- Fix an issue\n- Explain how something works\n- Create documentation\n- Something else\n\nOnce you clarify your needs, I can either help you directly or route your request through the orchestrator agent if it's a complex multi-step task.\n\nConfidence: 0.85\n\n\nVerify this synthesis and provide quality assessment in JSON format.",
