<!-- AURORA:START -->
**Guardrails**
- Favor straightforward, minimal implementations first and add complexity only when requested or clearly required.
- Keep changes tightly scoped to the requested outcome.
- Refer to `.aurora/AGENTS.md` if you need additional Aurora conventions or clarifications.

**Usage**
Archive completed plans with spec delta processing and validation.

**What it does**
1. Validates plan structure and task completion
2. Processes capability specification deltas (ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED/RENAMED)
3. Updates capability specs in `.aurora/capabilities/`
4. Moves plan to archive with timestamp: `.aurora/plans/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<plan-id>/`
5. Updates agents.json with `archived_at` timestamp

**Commands**
```bash
# Archive specific plan
aur plan archive 0001-oauth-auth

# Interactive selection (lists all active plans)
aur plan archive

# Archive with flags
aur plan archive 0001 --yes              # Skip confirmations
aur plan archive 0001 --skip-specs       # Skip spec delta processing
aur plan archive 0001 --no-validate      # Skip validation (with warning)
```

**Validation checks**
- Task completion status (warns if < 100%)
- Plan directory structure
- Spec delta conflicts and duplicates
- Agent assignments and gaps

**Reference**
- Plans archived to `.aurora/plans/archive/`
- Specs updated in `.aurora/capabilities/<capability>/spec.md`
- Incomplete plans can be archived with explicit confirmation
