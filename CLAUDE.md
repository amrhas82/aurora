# Aurora Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/.aurora/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like plan, create, implement)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, or architecture shifts
- Sounds ambiguous and you need authoritative guidance before coding

Use `@/.aurora/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and work with plans
- Aurora workflow and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'aur init --config' can refresh the instructions.
