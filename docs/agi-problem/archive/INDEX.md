# ARCHIVE INDEX

**Last Updated**: December 7, 2025
**Status**: Historical Reference & Iteration Records
**Purpose**: Preserve iteration history and clarification attempts while keeping working folders clean

## Archive Policy

All documents in this folder are **preserved but not active**:
- **Not deleted** (for traceability and learning history)
- **Not referenced** in current work (they're superseded)
- **Available for reference** if you need to trace decision evolution
- **Organized by category** for easy discovery

## /OLD-WS2-CLARIFICATION-ATTEMPTS - Iteration History from Dec 5-6

**16 documents showing research iteration and clarification process**

This folder contains all the intermediate documents created while refining WS2 research. They represent the evolution of thinking from December 5-6, 2025, leading up to the final APPROACH-1 and APPROACH-2 documents dated December 7, 2025.

### Key Clarification Documents
- **WS2-COMPREHENSIVE-SUMMARY.md** - Initial comprehensive overview attempt
- **WS2-DUAL-APPROACHES-SUMMARY.md** - First proposal of dual approaches
- **WS2-WHAT-HOW-HIERARCHY-FLOWS.md** - Attempted clarification of hierarchical reasoning
- **WS2-CLEAR-ANSWER.md** - Attempted direct answer to core questions
- **WS2-DOCUMENT-INDEX.md** - Initial document index attempt
- **RESEARCH-CONTRADICTION-RESOLVED.md** - Resolution of architectural contradictions

### Master Navigation & Reference Attempts
- **START-HERE-MASTER-NAVIGATION.md** - Early navigation guide
- **ARCHITECTURE-SUMMARY-QUICK-REFERENCE.md** - Quick reference summary attempt
- **CLARIFICATION-SOAR-vs-ACTR-TRUTH.md** - Clarification of SOAR vs ACT-R truth
- **THE-ACTUAL-TRUTH-SOAR-vs-ACTR.md** - Direct answer to architecture debate
- **FOLLOW-UP-ANSWERS-QUICK-GUIDE.md** - Quick answers to follow-up questions

### Reconciliation Documents
- **README-WS2-RECONCILIATION.md** - Reconciliation of different approaches
- **PRD-UPDATE-SUMMARY.md** - PRD update during iteration

### Why These Are Archived

These documents served their purpose during the research process: iterating, questioning, clarifying, and converging on final answers. The final, authoritative versions are:
- `/CURRENT-RESEARCH/WS2-APPROACH-1-SIMPLE-SOAR-ACT-R.md`
- `/CURRENT-RESEARCH/WS2-APPROACH-2-ADVANCED-SOAR-ACTR-TAO-MULTIMODEL.md`
- `/CURRENT-RESEARCH/WS2-APPROACHES-COMPARISON-DECISION-MATRIX.md`
- `/CURRENT-RESEARCH/WS2-HONEST-ASSESSMENT-SUMMARY.md`

### When to Reference
- **Tracing decisions**: See how thinking evolved
- **Understanding nuance**: Intermediate attempts often address specific questions
- **Learning process**: Understand iteration and refinement methodology
- **Not for**: Current implementation decisions (use `/CURRENT-RESEARCH/` instead)

---

## /OUTDATED-APPROACHES - Superseded Implementation Ideas

**2 documents representing earlier architectural approaches**

### Superseded Architectures
- **UNIFIED-SOLUTION-ARCHITECTURE-PSEUDOFLOW.md**
  - **Status**: Replaced by APPROACH-1 and APPROACH-2
  - **Why archived**: Complete redesign with clearer separation of concerns
  - **Lessons**: Shows earlier thinking before SOAR/ACT-R integration clarity

- **PRACTICAL-SOLO-IMPLEMENTATION.md**
  - **Status**: Replaced by detailed implementation checklists
  - **Why archived**: Superseded by `/research/core-research/IMPLEMENTATION-READY-CHECKLIST.md`
  - **Lessons**: Early practical thinking about solo implementation

### When to Reference
- **Implementation history**: Understanding how approach evolved
- **Not for**: Current implementation (use `/CURRENT-RESEARCH/` instead)

---

## /SESSION-NOTES - Research Session Records

**7 documents recording research progress, summaries, and reflections**

### Session Artifacts
- **SESSION-SUMMARY-DECEMBER-5-2025.md** - Session recap and findings
- **SESSION-2-EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md** - WS2 executive summary from session 2
- **RESEARCH-SESSION-REFLECTION.md** - Reflection on research process
- **WS2-INNOVATION-SUMMARY.md** - Summary of WS2 innovations
- **RESEARCH-CONTINUATION-PHASE-2-SUMMARY.md** - Phase 2 research continuation
- **VALIDATION-SUMMARY-PROS-AND-CONS.md** - Pros and cons validation
- **NEXT-SESSION-CHECKLIST.md** - Checklist for next session

### Why These Are Archived
These are session artifacts and process notes. While valuable for understanding research history, they're:
- Time-bound (December 5-7 sessions)
- Process-oriented (not strategic documents)
- Summarized in active documents (like `research-continuation.md`)

### When to Reference
- **Understanding session outcomes**: See what was discussed
- **Research history**: Trace decisions back to sessions
- **Process improvement**: Learn from how research was conducted
- **Not for**: Current decision-making (use active strategy/planning docs)

## How to Use the Archive

### If You Want to Understand Decision Evolution
1. Start: `/CURRENT-RESEARCH/` (final decisions)
2. Then: `/project/research-plans/` (strategic roadmap)
3. Reference: `OLD-WS2-CLARIFICATION-ATTEMPTS/` (how we got there)

### If You Want to Understand What Changed from Dec 5 to Dec 7
1. Read: `SESSION-NOTES/SESSION-SUMMARY-DECEMBER-5-2025.md`
2. Read: `CURRENT-RESEARCH/WS2-HONEST-ASSESSMENT-SUMMARY.md`
3. Understand: What evolved and why

### If You Need Implementation History
1. Reference: `OUTDATED-APPROACHES/`
2. Compare to: `/research/core-research/IMPLEMENTATION-READY-CHECKLIST.md`
3. Understand: Why approach changed

### If Someone Asks About Your Process
1. Share: How iteration worked (clarification attempts)
2. Show: Session notes and reflections
3. Explain: Why final documents represent best thinking
