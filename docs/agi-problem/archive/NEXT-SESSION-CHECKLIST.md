Create `core-research/INTERVENTION-TESTING-FRAMEWORK.md`:

**Define**:
1. **Confidence Levels**
   - How to measure confidence in predictions?

## 🚨 Critical Insights to Remember

1. **Intervention Breaks Confounding**: Passive observation learns correlation (60-70%), but testing alternatives learns causation (80-85%)

2. **Budget-Controlled**: 5% compute for learning, 95% for serving = enterprises accept it

3. **Three Confidence Levels**:
   - HIGH (>80%): Just observe
   - MEDIUM (60-80%): Monitor
   - LOW (<60%): Test alternatives

4. **PoW Analogy**: Don't trust history → Verify through testing

5. **Signal Quality is Critical**: Phase 1 success gate is achieving >75% accuracy

---

## 📞 Questions to Ask When Stuck

1. **For any research plan**: "What are the 4 phases with go/no-go gates?"
2. **For success metrics**: "Are these measurable and clear?"
3. **For risk assessment**: "What would cause this to fail?"
4. **For budget**: "Is this realistic for a small team?"
5. **For timeline**: "Can this be done in 6-9 months?"
