# PRD Update Summary: Solo AI-Driven Research Edition

**Date**: December 5, 2025
**Version**: 2.0 (Solo Project)

## What Changed

The Master PRD has been updated to reflect a **solo side project** where **AI agents conduct the research** while you coordinate and synthesize findings.

### Key Changes

#### 1. **No Funding/Hiring Focus**
- ❌ Removed: $7.1M funding requirement, team structure (6-11 FTE), salary budgets
- ✅ Added: Time commitment model (50 hours/month), AI agent research capacity

#### 2. **Research Execution Model**
- **Old**: Hire 6 researchers + operations team + grow to 11 FTE
- **New**: AI agents (market-researcher, architect, explore) conduct research; you coordinate findings

#### 3. **Infrastructure Requirements**
- **Old**: $300K/year (compute, APIs, conferences, tools)
- **New**: <$50/month (optional API testing only), everything else free or existing

#### 4. **Time Commitment**
- **Monthly**: 50 hours (~12-13 hours/week)
  - Research synthesis: 30-40 hours
  - Decision-making: 5-10 hours
  - Documentation: 10-15 hours

#### 5. **Go-To-Market Repositioned**
- **Old**: Move to enterprise pilots at month 13, Series A funding by month 18
- **New**: Complete research foundation ready for commercialization or open-source by month 18

#### 6. **Success Definition**
- **Old**: 2-3 enterprise pilots with measurable ROI, Series A secured
- **New**: 3-5 published research papers, proof-of-concept prototypes, complete architecture specs

### What Stays the Same

✅ **Research Problems** (all 5 workstreams unchanged):
1. Intelligence Portability Framework
2. Emergent Reasoning Architecture
3. Multi-Framework Convergence Layer
4. Self-Organizing Multi-Agent Systems
5. Integrated Test-Time Learning System

✅ **Timeline** (18 months):
- Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Foundational research
- Phase 2 (Months 7-12): Integration & synthesis
- Phase 3 (Months 13-18): Productization readiness

✅ **Success Metrics** (technical validation, research credibility)

✅ **Decision Gates** (monthly reviews + 5 major gates)

### Research Workflow Per Workstream

**6-9 weeks per workstream**:
1. **Weeks 1-2**: AI agent deep literature review + competitive analysis
2. **Weeks 3-4**: AI agent designs research questions + validation approaches
3. **Weeks 5-6**: AI agent synthesizes findings + creates implementation specs
4. **Weeks 7-9**: AI agent creates detailed technical designs
5. **Final**: You review, synthesize across workstreams, make decisions

### Risks Updated

**Removed**:
- Recruitment & retention challenges
- Funding availability concerns

**Added**:
- Time commitment sustainability (30% probability, mitigated by AI agent workload)
- Solo perspective limitations (35% probability, mitigated by multiple AI agents)

### Transition Path (Post-Month 18)

Research outputs ready for:
- **Commercialization**: Hand off to external team with complete specs
- **Open Source**: Community adoption of reference implementations
- **Licensing**: Partner with framework providers on integration
- **Consulting**: Advise other projects using research knowledge

## Next Steps

1. **Review PRD**: Ensure solo model matches your vision
2. **Schedule Research**: Plan Phase 1 workstream kickoffs
3. **Set Up Artifacts**: Organize research documents (GitHub/local)
4. **Monthly Reviews**: Schedule time for synthesis (suggest 1st Monday of each month)
5. **Begin Phase 1**: Dispatch AI agents to start research

## Key Metrics to Track

- **Phase 1 Gate (Month 6)**: ≥3/5 workstreams showing promise
- **Phase 2 Gate (Month 12)**: System design complete, prototype specs ready
- **Phase 3 Gate (Month 18)**: 3+ research papers, proof-of-concepts validated

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ **Flexibility**: Work at your own pace, extend timeline if needed
✅ **Scalability**: AI agents handle research workload (80%+)
✅ **Cost**: <$50/month (vs. $7.1M for traditional team)
✅ **Time**: 50 hours/month (vs. full-time employment)
✅ **Rigor**: Professional research conducted by AI agents
✅ **Ownership**: Complete control over direction and decisions

**PRD is updated and ready for research execution!**
