## Final Note

You asked three excellent clarifying questions that revealed gaps in my initial explanation. Rather than patching one document, I created a comprehensive set of 10 documents that cover:

1. **Completeness**: Both architectures equally, not just SOAR
2. **Structure**: Full WHAT/HOW hierarchies with flows
3. **Mechanism**: How memory persists without weights

The documents are organized so you can dive as deep as you want, in any order, depending on your needs. Use the index (this document) to navigate.

**Next**: Decide what you want to explore next. I can help with:
- Deep research on specific topics
- Implementation planning
- Market analysis
- Competitive positioning
- Or anything else these documents opened up
