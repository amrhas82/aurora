# Manual Verification: Error Handling (Task 5.6)

## Test Setup
- Corrupted database by replacing with text "CORRUPTED"
- AURORA_HOME: /tmp/aurora_manual_test

## Test Results

### Test 1: Corrupted database without debug flag
Command: `aur mem search "test"`
Result:
- Shows error message: "Search command failed: Failed to connect to database"
- Shows full Python traceback (even without debug flag)
- Exit code: 1

### Test 2: With AURORA_DEBUG=1
Command: `AURORA_DEBUG=1 aur mem search "test"`
Result:
- Same behavior as without debug flag
- Full traceback shown

## Issues Found
⚠️ Error handling decorator (@handle_errors) is not being used for memory commands
- Tracebacks are shown even in production mode (without --debug or AURORA_DEBUG=1)
- The error handling improvements from Task 2.0 are implemented but not applied to memory commands
- Exit code is 1 (user error) instead of 2 (system error) for StorageError

## Status
- Error messages are informative
- Exit codes work (non-zero)
- BUT: Tracebacks should be hidden unless debug mode is explicitly enabled
- This is a minor UX issue but doesn't block functionality

##Conclusion
⚠️ Partial success - errors are caught and reported, but debug mode behavior not fully working as designed
