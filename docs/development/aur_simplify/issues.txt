  code chunking issue end of aur soar
  Summary:

  The chunking warning is:
  - ⚠️ Pre-existing issue (not introduced by SOAR simplification)
  - Root cause: Some code path tries to access chunk.implementation on CodeChunk objects, but CodeChunk doesn't have this attribute
  - When it occurs: During conversation log indexing (post-SOAR execution)
  - Impact: Cosmetic warning only - doesn't affect SOAR pipeline functionality
  - Workaround: Add defensive code or add implementation property to CodeChunk

  To fix it properly (separate from SOAR work):
  1. Find where chunk.implementation is being accessed
  2. Either add defensive getattr(chunk, 'implementation', None) or
  3. Add implementation property to CodeChunk class

  Since this is unrelated to the SOAR simplification and doesn't break functionality, I recommend tracking it as a separate issue/PRD rather than fixing it now.

  Your SOAR simplification work is complete and working correctly! ✅
