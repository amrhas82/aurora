  code chunking issue end of aur soar
  Summary:

  The chunking warning is:
  - ⚠️ Pre-existing issue (not introduced by SOAR simplification)
  - Root cause: Some code path tries to access chunk.implementation on CodeChunk objects, but CodeChunk doesn't have this attribute
  - When it occurs: During conversation log indexing (post-SOAR execution)
  - Impact: Cosmetic warning only - doesn't affect SOAR pipeline functionality
  - Workaround: Add defensive code or add implementation property to CodeChunk

  To fix it properly (separate from SOAR work):
  1. Find where chunk.implementation is being accessed
  2. Either add defensive getattr(chunk, 'implementation', None) or
  3. Add implementation property to CodeChunk class

  Since this is unrelated to the SOAR simplification and doesn't break functionality, I recommend tracking it as a separate issue/PRD rather than fixing it now.

  Your SOAR simplification work is complete and working correctly! ✅

- aur spawn/aur gaols may need to use more directive prompt to get agents to execute

● You're right to flag this. The same problem will likely occur with aur spawn and aur goals - agents receiving tasks like:

  Implement user authentication

  ...and responding with "Hi! I'd be happy to help. What would you like me to do?" instead of just doing it.

  The fix could go in one of two places:

  1. In the spawner package itself (aurora_spawner/spawner.py) - wrap all prompts with directive instructions before piping to CLI
    - Pro: Fixes it for ALL consumers (aur spawn, aur goals, aur soar, future commands)
    - Con: Changes behavior globally, might be too aggressive for some use cases
  2. In each command (spawn.py, goals.py, collect.py) - each builds its own directive prompt
    - Pro: Commands can customize their prompt style
    - Con: Duplication, easy to forget in new commands

  The spawner-level fix makes more sense architecturally - if you're spawning an agent to do a task, you want it to execute, not chat. The spawner could have an optional directive=True flag (default True) that wraps prompts.

  But yes, you're sensing correctly - aur spawn tasks.md will likely have the same "greeting instead of working" problem right now. Worth noting for a follow-up fix.
