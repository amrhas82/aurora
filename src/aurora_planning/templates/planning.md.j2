## Overview

This document specifies the planning approach and decomposition strategy for achieving the goal: {{ goal }}

## Planning Strategy

### Decomposition Approach
{% if decomposition_approach %}
{{ decomposition_approach }}
{% else %}
The goal has been decomposed into {{ subgoals | length }} manageable subgoals, each assigned to a specialized agent. Subgoals are ordered by dependencies and can be executed in parallel where no dependencies exist.
{% endif %}

### Agent Assignment Rationale
{% for subgoal in subgoals %}
- **{{ subgoal.id }}** ({{ subgoal.agent_id }}): {{ subgoal.get('agent_rationale', 'Best suited for this type of work') }}
{% endfor %}

## Dependency Analysis

### Critical Path
{% if critical_path %}
{{ critical_path | join(' → ') }}
{% else %}
To be determined during implementation.
{% endif %}

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
{% if parallel_groups %}
{% for group in parallel_groups %}
- **Group {{ loop.index }}**: {{ group | join(', ') }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
Subgoals with no dependencies can be executed in parallel.
{% endif %}

## Risk Assessment

### Complexity Factors
- **Overall Complexity**: {{ complexity | default('medium') }}
- **Number of Subgoals**: {{ subgoals | length }}
- **Cross-team Dependencies**: {{ cross_team_dependencies | default(0) }}

### Planning Assumptions
{% if assumptions %}
{% for assumption in assumptions %}
- {{ assumption }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
- All required resources are available
- No external blockers
- Agent assignments are appropriate
{% endif %}

## Success Criteria for Planning

- [ ] All subgoals clearly defined
- [ ] Agent assignments appropriate
- [ ] Dependencies identified and manageable
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Risks identified and mitigated
